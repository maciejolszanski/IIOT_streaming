// turbo-all
1. Verify that you are currently on a feature branch (not `main` or `master`).
2. Update the `README.md` with recent changes, installation steps, or usage instructions.
3. Stage all changes using `git add .`.
4. Commit changes with a descriptive message following conventional commits (e.g., `docs: update readme with simulator instructions`).
5. Push the changes to the remote repository.
