description: Prepare the current branch for a Pull Request by updating docs, committing and pushing.

// turbo-all
1. Do it only if I ask you explicitly for preparing a PR
2. Verify that you are currently on a feature branch (not `main` or `master`).
3. Update the `README.md` with recent changes, installation steps, or usage instructions.
4. Stage all changes using `git add .`.
5. Commit changes with a descriptive message following conventional commits (e.g., `docs: update readme with simulator instructions`).
6. Push the changes to the remote repository.
